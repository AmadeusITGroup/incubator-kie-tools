# @kie-tools/xml-parser-ts

This package lets you parse/build XML strings from/to JSON using types and metadata generated with `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen`, based on XSD schemas. It uses DOMParser or `jsdom` to parse the XMLs and guarantees that:

- Parse/builds are idempotent after an initial normalizing parse.
  - Namespaces declared on the original XML can be preserved when building from the JSON.
- The JSON resulting from parsing is type-safe, as the metadata generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` provides information on what is a string, a boolean, an integer, a float, an array etc.
  - Even if there's only one element on a sequence, `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts` will make sure it is an array with length 1.
- The types generated by `@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen` can be extended and parsed/built.
- Unknown elements/attributes are kept in the original JSON.
- Comments are ignored.

### Usage:

```ts
import { getParser } from "@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts";

// For a document of type "My Schema 1.0" which had its
// type definitions generated with @kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen
import * as mySchema10 from "./schemas/my-schema-1.0/ts-gen/meta";
import type { MySchema10__RootElementType } from "./schemas/my-schema-1.0/ts-gen/types";

// Create the parser dedicated to "My Schema 1.0".
const mySchema10Parser = getParser<{ [mySchema10root.element]: MySchema10__tRootElement }>(mySchema10);
```

```ts
// Define a XML document.
const originalXml = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rootElement xmlns="https://kie.apache.org/my-schema-1.0" version="1.0">
  <childElement>Example child element content</childElement>
</rootElement>
`;

// Parse it to JSON.
const { json, instanceNs } = mySchema10Parser.parse({ type: "xml", xml: originalXml });

// Modify it.
// NOTE: This is 100% type-safe, based on the generated types
//       created by @kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen.
json.rootElement["@_version"] = "1.1";
// json.rootElement["@_version"] = 1 will not compile with "Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2322)"

// Build an XML.
// NOTE: `instanceNs` is used to maintain the same namespace
//       mapping as the original XML. You can also use
//       `mySchema10root.ns` to normalize it.
const newXml = mySchema10Parser.build({ json, instanceNs });

// Print the modified XML document.
console.log(newXml);
/**
 * Output:
 *
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
 * <rootElement xmlns="https://kie.apache.org/my-schema-1.0" version="1.1">
 *   <childElement>Example child element content</childElement>
 * </rootElement>
 *
 */
```

Apache KIE (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache Incubator. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating project’s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF
policy. For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing
conditions. What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently
aware of (note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

- Hibernate, an LGPL project, is being used. Hibernate is in the process of
  relicensing to ASL v2
- Some files, particularly test files, and those not supporting comments, may
  be missing the ASF Licensing Header

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project, please
be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review to determine
the overall implications of including this work. For the current status of this
project through the Apache Incubator visit:
