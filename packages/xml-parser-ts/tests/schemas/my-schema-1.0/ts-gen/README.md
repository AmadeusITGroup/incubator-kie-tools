This directory was auto-generated with the following command in the root folder of the [`@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts`](../../../../../xml-parser-ts/) package.

```shell
node ../xml-parser-ts-codegen/bin.js ./tests/schemas/my-schema-1.0/MySchema10.xsd rootElement
```

This process can't be automated due to the recursive nature of [`@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts`](../../../../../xml-parser-ts/) and [`@kie-tools/xml-parser-ts-codegen`](../../../../../xml-parser-ts-codegen/)
